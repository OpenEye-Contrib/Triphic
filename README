This directory contains the means to build the programs plurality,
triphic and loob.
Plurality is a program that searches a database for molecules with
given pharmacophore.
Triphic searches a database for molecules which have pharmacophore
features in a similar orientation to some or all of the features in a
query molecule.
Loob creates 3D pharmacophore fingerprints for a database of
molecules. 

To build it, use the CMakeLists.txt file in the src directory. It
requires the following environment variables to point to relevant
places:

OE_DIR - the top level of an OEChem distribution
BOOST - the location of a recent (>1.48) build of the Boost libraries
PVM_ROOT - the location of PVM (>3.4.3)

Then cd to src and do something like:
mkdir dev-build
cd dev-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..
make

If all goes to plan, this will make a directory src/exe_DEBUG with the
executables in it.

See the docs directory for instructions on running the program, and
test_dir for some useful example files.
