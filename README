This directory contains the means to build the programs plurality,
triphic and loob.

To build it, use the CMakeLists.txt file in the src directory. It
requires the following environment variables to point to relevant
places:

OE_DIR - the top level of an OEChem distribution
BOOST - the location of a recent (>1.48) build of the Boost libraries
PVM_ROOT - the location of PVM (>3.4.3)

Then cd to src and do something like:
mkdir dev-build
cd dev-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..
make

If all goes to plan, this will make a directory src/exe_DEBUG with the
executables in it.

See the docs directory for instructions on running the program, and
test_dir for some useful example files.
