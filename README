This directory contains the means to build the programs plurality,
triphic and loob.
Plurality is a program that searches a database for molecules with
given pharmacophore.
Triphic searches a database for molecules which have pharmacophore
features in a similar orientation to some or all of the features in a
query molecule.
Loob creates 3D pharmacophore fingerprints for a database of
molecules. 

To build it, use the CMakeLists.txt file in the src directory. It
requires the following environment variable to point to relevant
place:

OE_DIR - the top level of an OEChem distribution

Then cd to src and do something like:
mkdir dev-build
cd dev-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..
make

If all goes to plan, this will make a directory src/../exe_DEBUG with the
executables in it. These will have debugging information in them.

For a release version:
mkdir prod-build
cd prod-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make

and you'll get stuff in src/../exe_RELEASE which should have full
compiler optimisation applied.

If you're not wanting to use the system-supplied Boost distribution in
/usr/include then set BOOST_ROOT to point to the location of a recent
(>1.48) build of the Boost libraries.  On my Centos 6.5 machine, the
system boost is 1.41 which isn't good enough. You will also probably
need to use '-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=TRUE' when running cmake:

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=TRUE ..

See the docs directory for instructions on running the program, and
test_dir for some useful example files.
