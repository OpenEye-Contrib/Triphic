<h1>Triphic</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Triphic does pharmacophore-based 3D similarity searching of a file of
molecules. Most commonly, this will involve a single conformation of a
molecule querying an OEBin file. It can run in serial or parallel
using PVM.  It is similar in concept (though developed independently
of) the CLIP program of Rhodes et al. (JCICS, 43, 443-448 (2003)).

The triphic search is done by identifying, using SMARTS and points
files, features of interest in the query and database molecules and
using clique detection to find database molecules that have a features
of the same type and relative spatial arrangements as 3 or more of the
features in the query.  Any such database molecules are overlaid onto
the query using the matching features and scored.

<h2>Running Triphic</h2>
Triphic runs from the command line.  As a bare minimum you need a
query file, a database file and an output file.  There are numerous
other options controlling the scoring, defining features or feature
types that must be matched in the query etc.

<h3>Mandatory Arguments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    -D &lt;string&gt; or --db-file &lt;string&gt; Specifies the database to be
    searched, which can be anything that OEChem recognises. The file
    type is deduced from the extension, and it can deal with
    compressed files also. It can also
    read from standard input, again using standard OEChem
    nomenclature, but specifying a filename just by the extension, and
    piping the file into the executable. Thus the command 
      <pre>
	cat *.oeb.gz | ./triphic -D .oeb.gz
      </pre>
      will have triphic read all the .oeb.gz files in the directory
      sequentially. However, this will only work when running in
      serial mode. When parallel processing you specify
      multiple files using more than one -D option, as in 
      <pre>
	-D file1.oeb.gz -D file2.oeb.gz
      </pre>
    for as many files as you like, or you can use the
    --db-files-file option.
</li>
<li>
    -Q &lt;string&gt; or --query-file &lt;string&gt; Specifies the query file to
    use in the search. This will most likely be one or more
    single-conformation molecules in something that OEChem can read,
    but it can also be a <a href="#MOE_PH4_FILES">MOE pharmacophore (.ph4)</a> file.
</li>
<li>
    -O &lt;string&gt; or --output-file &lt;string&gt; The name of the output
    file. This must a molecule file name, which will hold the
    overlaid hits. A file with the extension .scores will also be
    created holding all the scores for the hits in the same order as
    the hits are in the molecule file.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A molecule file name means one
that ends in an extension that the OEChem toolkit recognises,
e.g. .mol2, .sdf, .oeb.gz etc. The format will be deduced from the
extension. You can specify a SMILES file, but the
amount of information about the overlays contained in the SMILES
file is low. 
</p>

<h3>Optional Arguements</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  --help Produces the help text. Giving no arguments or an incorrect
  argument will also have this effect.
</li>
<li>
  -S &lt;string&gt; or --smarts-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name of
  the <a href="points_and_smarts_files.html#SMARTS_FILES">SMARTS
  file</a> containing the definitions to be used for defining the
  pharmacophore features.
</li>
<li>
  -P &lt;string&gt; or --points-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name of
  the <a href="points_and_smarts_files.html#POINTS_FILES">points
  file</a> containing definitions of the features to be
  used in the searching, including some extra
  information about which directional vectors are to be
  included, if any. These are ring normals, X-H bond
  vectors or lone-pair vectors. If neither the SMARTS
  or points file is specified, a default set of
  definitions will be used which will probably do you
  right in most cases.
</li>
<li>
  --db-files-file Specifies a file containing the names of database
  files to be read. Used instead of giving multiple -D options. You
  can use both options in the same run if that's your thing.
</li>
<li>
  -M &lt;int&gt; or --max-hits &lt;int&gt; The maximum number of hits that will be
      output. It defaults to 1000. These are always the
      top-scoring hits for the search, according to the
      primary score. Giving a value of 0 means no maximum -
      all hits will be accumulated and output in sorted
      order. Make sure you've got enough memory! 
</li>
<li>
  --protein-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name of a molecule file containing a
    protein structure. As part of the scoring for each hit the overlap
    volume with the protein will be calculated. Optionally, the hit can
    be optimised in the field of the protein. For this to be useful, the
    query must be in the same reference frame as the protein, such that
    hits overlaid onto the query are in an orientation relevant to the
    protein. The overlap volume calculation is grid-based and the
    speed is largely independent of the size of the protein. 
    <li>
      --subset-file &lt;string&gt; A file containing names of molecules to be used
	in the search. Molecules in the database file not mentioned in this
	file will be ignored. The names must match exactly, so if your
	database file has been prepared according to some ionisation
	and/or tautomer model, and tautomer numbers have been added to the
	names in the database, those numbers must be added to the names in
	the subset. 
    </li>
    <li>
      -G &lt;string&gt; or --grid-score-file &lt;string&gt; The name of a grid file,
	  probably prepared by PSG. For each hit, the overlap
	  volume with the grid will be reported in the output
	  file. More than 1 grid can be used, but each one
	  needs a separate -G &lt;string&gt; option. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --primary-score &lt;string&gt; where &lt;string&gt; is one of &lt;RMS_AND_SIZE|ROBINS_PARETO|OVERALL_PARETO|GAUSS_SHAPE_TANI|GRID_SHAPE_TANI|SURFACE_OVLP_VOLUME|PROTEIN_CLASH|MMFF_ENERGY&gt;
	Specifies the primary score to be used for sorting the hits. The
	options are string values, only one of which should be
	attempted. The default is RMS_AND_SIZE. GAUSS_SHAPE_TANI,
	GRID_SHAPE_TANI and SURFACE_OVLP_VOLUME 
	refer to calculations between the query and each hit. The grid-based
	shape tanimoto, overlap volume and total volume will be reported for
	the hits, and can be used for the sorting and filtering of results
	if required. PROTEIN_CLASH is the overlap volume between the protein
	and each hit, and MMFF_ENERGY is the strain energy between same. If
	there is no protein, you'll get undefined behaviour. ROBINS_PARETO
	is very close to the scoring method from Robin Taylor, as used in
	CCDC's pharmacophore overlay program (JCAMD, 26, 451-472) and is the
	Pareto score from included volume, h-bond and hydrophobe scores. In
	the event of a Pareto tie (when sorting, neither of the two overlays
	being compared dominates) a mysterious percentage difference in the
	relevant scores is used as a tie-breaker. OVERALL_PARETO uses all
	the scores in the current search to come up with a best consensus
	order. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --ring-normal-vector &lt;IGNORE|SCREEN|ALIGN&gt; How to treat ring normal
	vectors. If this option is given, the points file must have
	specified which points are to be used for generating ring
	normals. The three options are strings, only one of which should be
	given. They refer to how the search and overlap procedure should use
	any ring normal vectors on features that match between the query and
	any hit. IGNORE is pretty easy. SCREEN says that the vectors in matching
	features must be aligned within a tolerance (see below) for the hit
	to be accepted. ALIGN takes the ends of the vectors and adds them to
	the matching features and the alignment repeated. This will try and
	bring the ring normals into closer alignment than they were. After
	the ALIGN has been carried out, the SCREEN criteria are applied. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --ring-normal-tolerance &lt;float&gt; Gives the tolerance on the directions
	of ring normal vectors when they are being used in SCREEN or ALIGN
	mode. Default is 30 degrees.
    </li>
    <li>
      --h-bond-donor-vector &lt;IGNORE|SCREEN|ALIGN&gt; How to treat H-bond donor
	vectors. Similar remarks apply as to ring normal vectors, with the
	addition that if the X-C bond is deemed rotatable (if it's a single
	bond, and the X atom (O or N) is not conjugated with a pi-system)
	the X-H bond will be aligned as closely as possible with the query
	first by rotation about the X-C bond.
    </li>
    <li>
      --h-bond-donor-tolerance &lt;float&gt; Same as for ring normal vectors. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --h-bond-acceptor-vector &lt;IGNORE|SCREEN|ALIGN&gt; And the same for H-bond
	acceptor vectors
    </li>
    <li>
      --h-bond-acceptor-tolerance &lt;float&gt; Likewise. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --optimise-ligand-rigid Specifies that a rigid-body optimisation of
      each hit within the protein should be performed. There's no subtlety
      about this, and it's more than likely that the ligand will ping
      miles out of the active site if there's any sort of clash. Unless a
      bit of it is so embedded that it's trapped. It uses OpenEye's
      implementation of the MMFF forcefield for the optimisation
      (Szybki toolkit), and the
      final energy is reported as a score. If you're checking the
      alignment of vectors, this is done after the optimisation. If
      you don't have a license for the Szybki toolkit, this option
      will be ignored.
    </li>
    <li>
      --optimise-ligand-flexi Same as above, but with the ligand allowed
      torsional flexibility. In both cases, the protein is kept
      rigid.
    </li>
    <li>
      --min-clique-size &lt;int&gt; Minimum size of clique for a hit i.e. minimum
	number of matching features between the query and the hit. Defaults
	to 3. You need at least 3 features for a sensible overlay.
    </li>
    <li>
      --dist-tol &lt;float&gt; The tolerance on distances between matching
	features. This is not the maximum RMS distance in the overlay, but
	the tolerance on matching pairs of features passed into the
	clique-detection algorithm that determines whether there's a hit or
	not. If A in the query matches A' in the target molecule, and B
	matches B' then for both A and B to appear as matching features, the
	distance between A and B must be the same as the distance between A'
	and B' with the tolerance. The default is 1 Angstrom. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --scaled-dist-tol &lt;float&gt; This introduces a scaled tolerance instead
	of the --dist-tol fixed value. The tolerance, as described above,
	becomes the A to A' distance multiplied by the scaling factor, so
	that nearer features have a tighter tolerance than features that
	are further apart. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --max-rms &lt;float&gt; This is the maximum RMS between overlaid matching
	features in the query and hit. Default is 2.5 Angstrom. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --min-gauss-shape-tanimoto &lt;float&gt; The minimum Gaussian shape tanimoto
	between the query and a hit for the hit to be accepted. Can be any
	number, but if it is to be effective, needs to be between 0.0 and
	1.0. The default, -1.0, means no filtering. The shape tanimotos
	aren't quite the same as those calculated by ROCS - the formula's
	the same, but different approximations are used. There is a
	reasonable correlation in the limited set I compared. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --min-grid-shape-tanimoto &lt;float&gt; Similar to
	--min-gauss-shape-tanimoto. This is the grid calculation that the
	more recent manifestations of triphic used. It was deemed too slow
	for some applications but it is, in my opinion, more
	correct. There is a strong but not complete correlation with the
	Gaussian shape tanimoto. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --max-mmff-energy &lt;float&gt; A cutoff on MMFF energy between the ligand
	and protein. Hits with an energy greater than the cutoff won't be
	reported. The default is the largest floating point number your
	machine can think of (MAX_FLOAT) and so is effectively no cutoff. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --min-surface-volume &lt;float&gt; A cutoff on the surface overlap volume
	between the query and the hit. Hits that have less than this value
	will be discarded. Defaults to 0.0. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --max-protein-clash &lt;float&gt; A cutoff on the overlap volume between the
	protein and the hit. Hits that intrude into the protein by more than
	this value will be discarded. Default is MAX_FLOAT. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --min-included-volume &lt;float&gt; A cutoff on the overlap volume between
	the query and the hit. Hits that have an overlap volume less than
	this will be discarded. Default is MaX_FLOAT.
    </li>
    <li>
      --no-hit-conf-number Specifies that the hit molecules should not have
      the conformation number added to the name, but should just be called
      the same as the parent molecule. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --output-query-to-hits If the query is a molecule, then the query
      structure is written to the top of the output file. There will be no
      corresponding line in the scores file, though, so there should be 1
      more molecule in the output file than score in the scores file. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --print-sites-and-stop Runs the program until the query sites have
      been generated, prints details of same to screen and stops. Useful
      if you are going to want to specify required sites (see below). 
    </li>
    <li>
      --comma-output Specifies that the scores file should have
      comma-separated fields. The default is spaces. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --output-scores-only Specifies that just the scores file should be
      produced, not the molecules file. You still specify the output file
      as a molecule file though. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --single-conf-mols Specifies that the database file is to be treated
      as a collection of single conformation molecules. Only relevant for
      ASCII molecule files such as MOL2 or SDF. The default behaviour is
      to assume that molecules with the same name and connection pattern
      are different conformations of the same molecule. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --req-sites-or &lt;string&gt; Specifies that the named site must be added to
	the OR'ed list of required sites. One or more of the OR'ed required
	sites must be matched in the query by a site in the hit for the hit
	to be accepted. If you want more than one site in the OR'ed list,
	you must give multiple --req-sites-or &lt;string&gt; options. Site means a
	  specific instance of a feature in the query
	  e.g. Site_1_acceptor. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --req-sites-and &lt;string&gt; Similar to previous option, but the named
	site is added to the AND'ed list. All query sites mentioned in the
	AND'ed list must be matched by a feature in the hit for the hit to
	be accepted. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --req-points-or &lt;string&gt; Similar to req-sites-or except it refers to a
	feature type rather than a specific site, so would be something like
	acceptor or donor. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --req-points-and &lt;string&gt; Similar to req-sites-and. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --ignore-sites &lt;string&gt; Removes the named site from the query before
	the searching starts. Can be used more than once. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --dont-give-me &lt;string&gt; Specifies a file of SMARTS definitions, that
	may have vector bindings, and/or may use vector bindings from the
	main SMARTS file, that the hits may not match. Database molecules
	that match any SMARTS so specified will not be searched further. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --i-already-know-about &lt;string&gt; Synonymous with ---dont-give-me-file 
    </li>
    <li>
      --sites-score-file &lt;string&gt; Specifies a file of molecule structures,
	for use when the query file is in MOE ph4 format.  The
	molecule in the file will be used to calculate the
	normal volume scores during the run, such as the shape tanimoto,
	that aren't normally available in a ph4 query because there isn't
	a structure to work with. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --gauss-shape-tanimoto Specifies that the Gaussian shape tanimoto
      should be calculated between each hit and the corresponding
      query. The default is for this to be true, and, thinking about it, I
      don't think it can be turned off! 
    </li>
    <li>
      --grid-shape-tanimoto Specifies that the grid-based shape tanimoto,
      included volume and total volume between each hit and the query
      should be calculated. By default, they aren't, to save time, unless
      some other option requires it, such as min-grid-shape-tanimoto. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --all-best-hits By default, triphic returns at most one hit per target
      molecule, the one with the best primary score. This option has it
      putting out all the best hits from each target molecule. So if there
      are two different sets of features that both match between the query
      and the target, both will be reported. If for a given matched set
      there is more than one conformation that matches, the best match by
      primary score is returned. That's what the 'all the best hits' bit
      means. This option does not over-ride the --max-hits argument, nor
      does it alter the sorting of the hits - the hits are still fed into
      the sorted hit list in the normal way and truncated at the maximum
      number. So if you're going to use this option, you'd probably be
      better raising the --max-hits number or setting it to 0. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --dont-do-sub-cliques By default, if a clique is found that is larger
      than --min-clique-size, triphic also generates all sub-cliques down
      to that size. This can slow things down quite a lot as the number of
      overlays that need scoring shoots up, and you might not always want
      it. So this option turns off that behaviour. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --slave-name &lt;string&gt; Specifies the name of the executable to be used
	as a slave when running under PVM in parallel. 
    </li>
    <li>
      --num-slave-procs &lt;int&gt; Specifies the number of slave processes to be
	used when running under PVM in parallel.
    </li>
<li>
  --pvm-hosts-file <string> Gives the name of a hosts file, with
    numbers of processes to run on each named hosts. Expects the file
    to have multiple lines, each line containing the name of a host
    and the number of slaves to run on it. It's the best was of
    running on the AP cluster, as the job starter makes the file for
    you. You just need to give it the slave name with --slave-name and
    away you go. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="MOE_PH4_FILES">MOE Pharmacophore Files</a></h3>
MOE is a molecular modelling program from the Chemical Computing Group
(ccG).  It can be used to create pharmacophores and those can be
written to file for database searching.  It has a fairly complex and
not, as far as I know, documented, format. Triphic uses just the feature
points and included volumes bits. I think that's all the useful
stuff in the file, but it's difficult to be sure. Extension points can
also be used as part of the query. If they are clearly associated with
a base site, they will be converted into site directions such as
triphic has always had as an option. MOE also lets you specify them
'naked', such as when setting up the query from a protein active
site. In this case, the virtual sites from ROBINS_PARETO scoring are
used from each database conformation to match. This is the best
method yet found for making triphic crawl at an appallingly slow rate,
because it dramatically increases the number of features in the
database conformation, meaning vastly more cliques to be scored. A
hydroxyl produces 12 virtual site points, for example. In one simple
test case, adding a single extension point to the query increased the
number of cliques to be scored by a factor of 40, and two extension
points by a factor of 60. You probably want to use
--dont-do-sub-cliques at least when doing big searches or preliminary
screening. Included volumes in the PH4 file will be reported as
overlay volumes MOE_Volume_1 etc.
