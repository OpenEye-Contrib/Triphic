<h1>Plurality</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Plurality is a 3D pharmacophore searching tool. It reads molecule
files such as OEBin files written
by OpenEye's omega program and runs in parallel using the PVM
parallelisation routines. It aims to perform relatively
straightforward pharmacophore searches quickly - with a reasonable
number of parallel processes (10-20 or so) it can search about 25
million conformations in a few tens of minutes.
</p>
<p>
The search file for plurality is a simple ASCII file containing a list
of feature types and geometrical information about their relative
positions (distances, angles and torions between them, in ranges) as
well as, optionally, coordinates for the features so that hits can be
overlaid into a common reference frame, and hard and soft excluded
volumes. Additionally, a molecular structure can be specified in a
separate file and the overlap volume of overlaid hits with this
structure will be reported. Unlike Triphic, Plurality reports all hits
(see below for what constitute separate hits), not just the highest
scoring ones. That's because there's no real concept of a score for
this type of search.  
</p>
<h2>Command-line Arguments</h2>
Command-line arguments are processed using the boost::program_options
toolkit, which is very convenient to use, gives a consistent style
and is largely self-documenting. Some of the more frequently-used
options have single capital letter abbreviations, and all options can
be contracted to their smallest unambiguous piece. 
<ul>
<li>
    --help Produces the help text. Giving no arguments or an incorrect
    argument will also have this effect.
</li>
<li>
    -Q &lt;string&gt; or --pphore-file &lt;string&gt; Specifies the name of the
    query file, in <a href="#PPHORE_FILE_FORMAT">Plurality's own format</a>.
</li>
<li>
    -D &lt;string&gt; or --db-file &lt;string&gt; Specifies the database to be
    searched, which can be anything that OEChem recognises. The file
    type is deduced from the extension, and it can deal with
    compressed files also.  It can also
    read from standard input, again using standard OEChem
    nomenclature, but specifying a filename just by the extension, and
    piping the file into the executable. AS for triphic, you can't do
    the 'cat and pipe' trick when running in parallel. You can,
    however, specify multiple database files for the same run by
    giving more than one -D <filename> options, or using the
    --db-files-file option. 
</li>
<li>
    --db-files-file &lt;string&gt; Specifies the name of a file containing
    the names of the database files to be searched. Useful for
    searching the ISAC VSDB files, where ISAC is split into multiple
    files. Sam's new process helpfully creates such a file which you
    can use directly.
</li>
<li>
    -S &lt;string&gt; or --smarts-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name
    of the <a href="points_and_smarts_files.html#SMARTS_FILES">SMARTS
    file</a> containing the definitions to be used for defining the
    pharmacophore features.
</li>
</li>
    -P &lt;string&gt; or --points-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name
 of the <a href="points_and_smarts_files.html#POINTS_FILES"> points
    file</a> containing definitions of the features to be used in the
    searching, including some extra information about which
    directional vectors are to be included, if any. These are ring
    normals, X-H bond vectors or lone-pair vectors.
</li>
<li>
    -O &lt;string&gt; or --output-file &lt;string&gt; The name of the output
    file. This must be a molecule file name, which will hold the
    overlaid hits. A file with the extension .scores will also be
    created holding all the
    scores for the hits in the same order as the hits are in the
    molecule file. A molecule file name means one
    that ends in an extension that the OEChem toolkit recognises,
    e.g. .mol2, .sdf, .oeb etc. The format will be deduced from the
    extension.
</li>
<li>
    --protein-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name of a molecule file
    containing a protein structure. As part of the scoring for each
    hit the overlap volume with the protein will be calculated. The
    overlap volume calculation is grid-based and the speed is largely
    independent of the size of the protein. Although the option is
    called --protein-file, it doesn't have to 
    be a protein. If you're interested in the included volume between
    another ligand and any hits, then use this option for that, too.
</li>
<li>
    -G &lt;string&gt; or --grid-score-file &lt;string&gt; The name of a grid file,
    probably prepared by PSG. For each hit, the overlap volume with
    the grid will be reported in the output file. More than 1 grid can
    be used, but each one needs a separate -G &lt;string&gt; option. This is
    more flexible than the protein-file option, and probably
    supersedes it, except that protein-file is a molecule file, so is
    a bit more convenient in that you don't have to make a grid in a
    separate step.
</li>
<li>
    --scores-only Specifies that just the scores file should be
    produced, not the structures of the hits. Useful if you're just
    using Plurality for screening for, for example, acquisition, and
    you don't care too much about the conformations, in which case you
    would probably also want to specify --hits-to-output ONE_HIT_ONLY.
</li>
<li>
    --subset-file &lt;string&gt; Allows you to supply the name of a file
    containing names of molecules that should be searched as a subset
    of the full database file. The names must match exactly, so if
    your database file has been prepared according to some
    ionisation and/or tautomer model, and tautomer numbers have been
    added to the names in the database, those numbers must be added to
    the names in the subset.
</li>
<li>
    ---hits-to-output &lt;BEST_HITS_ONLY|ONE_HIT_ONLY|ALL_HITS&gt; This
    option specifies which hits should be output, both to the
    structure file and the scores file. The default is
    BEST_HITS_ONLY. A hit in this instance is defined as a distinct
    set of features in a conformation. In the default setting, just
    one hit is produced for a set of features, in the conformation
    with the best RMS overlay with the target coordinates. The same
    database molecule will produce more than one hit only if there is
    more than one set of features that match the query in at least one
    conformation. If ALL_HITS is specified, then all conformations
    where there is a set of features that match the query will be
    reported, even if this means all conformations of the
    molecule. ONE_HIT_ONLY means that once one hit has been
    identified, the search moves on.
</li>
<li>
    --comma-output Tells Plurality to output the scores file as a
    comma-separated list, rather than the default space-separated one.
</li>
<li>
    --dont-give-me &lt;string&gt; Specifies a file of SMARTS definitions,
    that may have vector bindings, and/or may use vector bindings from
    the main SMARTS file, that the hits may not match. Database
    molecules that match any SMARTS so specified will not be searched
    further.
</li>
<li>
    --i-already-know-about &lt;string&gt; Synonymous with
    ---dont-give-me-file
</li>
<li>
    --slave-name &lt;string&gt; Specifies the name of the executable to be
    used as a slave when running under PVM in parallel.
</li>
<li>
    --num-slave-procs &lt;int&gt; Specifies the number of slave processes to
    be used when running under PVM in parallel.
</li>
<li>
    --pvm-hosts-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name of a hosts file, with
    numbers of processes to run on each named hosts. Expects the file
    to have multiple lines, each line containing the name of a host
    and the number of slaves to run on it.
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="PPHORE_FILE_FORMAT">Pharmacophore File Format</a></h3>

The pharmacophore is specified in a simple ASCII format. The minimum
that must be specified is 2 or more feature types and a
distance range. Normally, though, you'd be looking for
something a bit more specific than this, and to that end you
can include coordinates for the points, onto which hits will
be overlaid, angles and torsions between points and vectors
stemming from points and excluded volumes, both hard, into
which the hit must not intrude, and soft, where the intrusion
of the hit is merely calculated and reported. Each of these
options is specified on a separate line in the file, with a
keyword first followed by the appropriate number of items of
data. It is not necessary to specify all possible combinations
of distance, angle or torsion for the query, just those of
interest. Any that aren't specified are allowed to take any
value. Lines starting with # are ignored as comments. 

<ul>
<li>
        Point &lt;string&gt; Specifies a point in the query. The
        string is a name from the points file.
</li>
<li>
        Coords &lt;int&gt; &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt;
        Specifies the coordinates of a point, onto which the
        corresponding feature in a hit molecule will be overlaid. The
        int is the sequence number of the point in question, as
        specified in the pharmacophore file, counting from 1. The 3
        floats are the x, y and z coordinates.
</li>
<li>
        Distance &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt;
        Specifies a distance range for the two features given by the
        ints. Hits must have two features corresponding to the point
        numbers within the distance range given. The first float is
        the lower distance in the range, the second the upper
        limit. If you get these the wrong way round, you'll get no
        hits - it doesn't correct things for you.
</li>
<li>
  Angle &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;float&gt;
  &lt;float&gt; Specifies an angle range for the three features given
  by the ints. If two of the ints are the same, then one is assumed to
  refer to the end of a direction stemming from the feature. Thus, in
  the line
<pre>
Angle 1 2 2 30.0 90.0
</pre>
the angle specified is between point 1, point 2 and any directional
vector stemming from point 2. For example, if point 2 is an h-bond
donor for which H_VECTOR_POINTS has been specified in the points file
then the angle would be between point 1 and the X-H vector on the
donor. If the donor is rotatable, then Plurality will attempt to line
it up before calculating the angle. The line 
<pre>
Angle 2 2 1 30.0 90.0
</pre>
is equivalent to the example above - the 'outer' duplicate int always
specifies the end of the directional vector. 
</li>
<li>
        Torsion &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
        &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt; Similar to Angle, but specifies a
        torsion, so 4 ints are required. Either the first pair, or the
        second pair, or both, can be the same, so enabling torsions
        between directional vectors to be screened, for example the
        angle between the planes of two aromatic rings.
</li>
<li>
        hxvol &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt;
        Specifies a hard excluded volume as x, y and z coordinates of
        a point, followed by a radius. Any hit that, once overlaid,
        has an atom that is within a distance of (excluded volume
        radius + atom radius) of the excluded volume's coordinates is
        discarded. The hard excluded volume thus denotes areas where
        the hit may not go.
</li>
<li>
        sxvol &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt; &lt;float&gt;
        Specifies a soft excluded volume. For these, just the overlap
        volume with the hit is calculated and put in the scores
        file. Hits that encroach too much onto the soft excluded
        volumes can be filtered out later.  
</li>
</ul>
