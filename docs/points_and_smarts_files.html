<h1>Points and SMARTS files</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a href="triphic.html">Triphic</a>, <a href="plurality.html">Plurality</a>
and <a href="loob.html">Loob</a> all require features to be defined
using a combination of SMARTS and points definitions. The former
define different types of functional group. and the latter are used to
group them together into feature types.
<h2><a name="SMARTS_FILES">SMARTS files</a></h2>
<p>
The SMARTS file format was originally developed by Pete Kenny for use
with a program called Structanal, for counting substructural
occurrences in molecules. It's a relatively simple format that has
stood the test of time, although at least one of the elements is no
longer strictly necessary. The SMARTS are specified one line per
definition:
<pre>
benzene c1ccccc1 1 0
biphenyl [$benzene]-[$benzene] 1 1
</pre>

The first field is the label for the SMARTS, the second is the SMARTS
definition, the third is the redundant field, and the fourth is either
a 0 or a 1, and denotes whether the definition is a vector binding (or
SMARTS sub-definition) or a full definition. In the example above, the
benzene SMARTS is a vector binding, the biphenyl SMARTS uses it in its
definition. Now that we use OpenEye's OEChem routines for the SMARTS
matching, the distinction is no longer strictly necessary, but is kept
in for historical reasons and/or backward compatibility. 
</p>
<p>
Any line that starts with a # is treated as a comment. You can't have
comments part-way along a line, as you can with, for example, shell
scripts, because a # is also used in SMARTS to mean a triple bond, so
there would be ambiguity. There's no problem at the start of the line,
as that's where the SMARTS name goes.
</p>
<h2><a name="POINTS_FILES">Points Files</a></h2>
<p>
The Points file was originally developed for Plurality, but is also
used in Triphic, Loob and SMG. The purpose is to
group SMARTS definitions together so that they are treated
equivalently. The motivation behind it was the need to be able
to treat the centroids of different-sized rings as equivalent,
particularly so that aromatic ring centroids for 5- and
6-membered rings could be treated as the same type of
pharmacophoric point. This is not possible by merging SMARTS
definitions as in


<pre>
	 arom5 a1aaaa1 1 0
	 arom6 a1aaaaa1 1 0
	 ring [$arom5,$arom6] 1 1
</pre>
(normal SMARTS_file format). When two SMARTS sub-definitions specify
different numbers of atoms, the SMARTS matcher returns just the
'head' atom of the SMARTS. In a generic ring such as those
above, it is completely arbitrary which atom is returned, since
they are all equivalent, so the ring position is not
unambiguously determined. The only way to do so is to match all
the atoms and take the centroid or average of the atom
positions. To do this in the example above, one must match the
SMARTS patterns separately and combine them at a higher level
than the SMARTS search, and that's what the Points file is
for. 
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>
The format is very straightforward. Each point type is specified on a separate line, consisting of the point name and the names of the SMARTS definitions that describe the point. There are also a few keywords that are interpreted by the file parser, of which more later. An example of a Points file commonly used for pharmacophore searching is

<pre>
# define points for donor, acceptor, aromatic an aliphatic hydrophobe
donor  NeuDon
acceptor  NeuAcc
aromatic AromFive AromSix
hphobe ITMOC_ALO
# directional vectors for points
H_VECTOR_POINTS donor
LP_VECTOR_POINTS acceptor
RING_NORMAL_POINTS aromatic
</pre>

Lines that start with a # are treated as comments and ignored. The
first two point types defined, donor and acceptor, have only 1 SMARTS
definition associated with them. The third point type, aromatic is the
centroid of atoms hit by either SMARTS definition AromFive or
AromSix. The fourth point type, hphobe is defined by a keyword (see
below) rather than a SMARTS definition. The final 3 lines of the file
use keywords (see below) associated with the points previously
defined. 
</p>

<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>
The words in upper case in the above example are keywords that some of
the programs that use Points files recognise and act upon. If you use
them in a Points file for a program that doesn't care, they will be
ignored. The recognised words are:

<ul>
<li>
        H_VECTOR_POINTS specifies that X-H vectors are to be added to
        the named points
</li>
<li>
        LP_VECTOR_POINTS specifies that lone pair vectors be added to
        the named points
</li>
<li>
        RING_NORMAL_POINTS specifies that ring normal vectors be added
        to the named points
</li>
<li>
        ITMOC specfies the use of the Catalyst algorithm for
        hydrophobe definition
</li>
<li>
        ITMOC_ALO specifies the use of the aliphatic part of the
        Catalyst algorithm for hydrophobe definition 
</li>
</ul>
The first three, H_VECTOR_POINTS, LP_VECTOR_POINTS and
RING_NORMAL_POINTS are used at the start of a line in the Points file,
and are followed by the name of one or more points types. You can use
them with any points, defined by any SMARTS pattern, but they are only
really intended to be used for h-bond donors, h-bond acceptors and
ring centroids respectively. The first two assume that the SMARTS will
hit a single atom - behaviour is not defined if more than 1 atom is
hit. The RING_NORMAL_POINTS directive needs SMARTS that hit at least 3
atoms for correct functioning; again, fewer than that will give
undefined behaviour. Keywords ITMOC and ITMOC_ALO are used in the
points definitions as 'pseudo-SMARTS' targets i.e. they appear on a
line defining a point as if they were the name of a SMARTS
pattern. They instruct the program to build feature points using the
algorithm for hydrophobes used by Catalyst (JCICS, 34, 1297-1308
(1994)). The former is the full
calculation for aromatic and aliphatic hydrophobes, the latter is just
the aliphatic part. You can't use the RING_NORMAL_POINTS keyword with
the ITMOC pseudo-SMARTS, so if you want to line aromatic rings up,
you'll need to use explicit SMARTS definitions for aromatic systems,
and then, possibly, the ITMOC_ALO keyword to include the aliphatic
hydrophobes.
