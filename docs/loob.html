<title>Loob - 3D Pharmacophore Fingerprints</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Loob</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Loob is a program that generates 3D pharmacophore fingerprints in
  the manner of Good et. al. (JCAMD, 18, 523-527 (2004)). It was
  originally written to help Jamal Saeh develop SVM models of GPCR
  activities (JCIM, 45, 1122-1133 (2005)), but are used
  and (apparently) useful for other things. It requires 3D
  conformations (1 or more per molecule) as input, and some
  definitions of features of interest.  It has some default
  definitions for h-bond donors and acceptors and hydrophobes built
  in, but these can be over-ridden.  The features are mapped onto
  each conformation, and distances between them calculated.  A
  fingerprint is then created where each bit represents features
  within certain distance ranges of each other.  It can produce
  fingerprints based on feature pairs, triplets (triangles) and
  quadruplets (tetrahedra). By default, all conformations of a
  molecule go into the same fingerprint.</p> 

<h2>Running Loob</h2>
<p>Loob runs from the command line. As a bare minimum you need a file
  of molecule structures. Most normally, this will be an OEBin file,
  created by OpenEye's Omega program</p> 

<h3>Command-line Options</h3>
<p>
The command-line arguments are processed using the
boost::program_options toolkit, which is very convenient to use, gives
a consistent style and is largely self-documenting. Some of the more
frequently-used options have single capital letter abbreviations, and
all options can be contracted to their smallest unambiguous piece.
<ul>
  <li>
    --help Produces the help text. Giving no arguments or an incorrect
    argument will also have this effect.
  </li>
  <li>
    -D &lt;string&gt; or --db-file &lt;string&gt; Specifies the database to be
	used for the structures, which can be anything that OEChem
	recognises. The file type is deduced from the extension, and it
	can deal with compressed files also.  It can also read from
	standard input, again using tandard OEChem nomenclature, but
	specifying a filename just by the extension, and piping the
	file into the executable. Thus the command 
	<pre>
	  cat *.oeb.gz | ./loob -D oeb.gz
	</pre>
	will have loob read all the .oeb.gz files in the directory
	sequentially.
  </li>
  <li>
    -S &lt;string&gt; or --smarts-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name
    of the <a href="points_and_smarts_files.html#SMARTS_FILES">SMARTS
	file</a> containing the definitions to be used for defining the
	pharmacophore features.
  </li>
  <li>
    -P &lt;string&gt; or --points-file &lt;string&gt; Gives the name
	of the <a href="points_and_smarts_files.html#POINTS_FILES">points
	file</a> containing definitions of the features to be used in the
	fingerprint. Loob takes no account of the directional keywords in
	the points file, although it won't object to them being there, but
	you can have Catalyst hydrophobes if that's your thing.
  </li>
  <li>
    --subset-file &lt;string&gt; A file containing names of molecules to
      have their fingerprints generated. Molecules in the database file
      not mentioned in this file will be ignored. The names must match
      exactly, so if your database file has been prepared according to
      some sort of ionisation and/or tautomer model, and tautomer
      numbers have been added to the names in the database, those
      numbers must be added to the names in the subset.
  </li>
  <li>
    --pairs Specifies the inclusion of pair bits in the
    fingerprint. These are two features and a distance bin.
  </li>
  <li>
    --triplets Specifies the inclusion of triplet bits in the
    fingerprint. These are three features and three distance
    bins. This is the default output if none of pairs, triplets or
    quadruplets is specified.
  </li>
  <li>
    --quadruplets Specifies the inclusion of quadruplet bits in the
    fingerprint. These are four features and six distance bins.
  </li>
  <li>
    --single-conf-mols Directs Loob to treat each entry in a MOL2 or
    SDF file as a separate molecule, rather than lumping all
    consecutive entries with the same name and connection table into a
    single molecule record with multiple conformations. Has no effect
    if the input file is an OEBin.
  </li>
  <li>
    --chiral-fps This only applies to quadruplet bits, and specifies
    that chirality should be taken into account when generating the
    bits. In principle, it will double the number of quadruplet
    bits. The default is not to use it.
  </li>
  <li>
    --bit-separator &lt;string&gt; Gives the separator to use between bits
      in ASCII output files. By default, no separator is used. For
      tab-separated files, use --bit-separator "\t" and for
      space-separated files use --bit-separator " ".
  </li>
  <li>
    -B &lt;float&gt; or --distance-bound &lt;float&gt; Specifies a distance bound
	to use for the distance bins. The default bounds are 4.5, 7.0,
	10.0, 14.0, 19.0 and 24.0, giving the bin ranges 0-4.5, 4.5-7.0,
	7.0-10.0, 10.0-14.0, 14.0-19.0 and 19.0-24.0. If the distance
	falls on the boundary edge, it goes into the lower bin. You need a
	separate -B &lt;float&gt; for each distance bound, so to specify the
	  defaults explicitly, you would need to say -B 4.5 -B 7.0 -B 10.0
	  -B 14.0 -B 19.0 -B 24.0. If you specify the bounds yourself, Loob
	  assumes you got it right, so make sure they're in correct
	  ascending order.
  </li>
  <li>
    --dont-compress-fps By default, Loob only reports bits that are
    set in at least one molecule. This makes the fingerprint more
    compact because columns of all 0 are removed, but it means that
    the fingerprints aren't directly comparable from database to
    database. Specifying this option means that all bits are written
    so that all fingerprint files with the same settings contain the
    same number of bits per molecule.
  </li>
  <li>
    --bit-labels-to-ascii-file Specifies that in the ASCII output
    files, the short names of the bits are written on the first line
    of the file, to ease import of the data into JMP, CART or other
    analysis programs.
  </li>
  <li>
    --compressed-counts-cutoff &lt;int&gt; If using compressed fingerprints
      (the default) bits are only written if they appear in at least one
      molecule. This option raises that cutoff so you can report just
      the bits that only appear in 5 molecules, for example.
  </li>
  <li>
    --ascii-fps-file &lt;string&gt; The name of a file to which ASCII
      fingerprints will be written i.e. 1s or 0s.
  </li>
  <li>
    --compact-fps-file &lt;string&gt; The name of a file to which compact
      fingerprints will be written. These are comma-separated lists of
      the numbers of the set bits.
  </li>
  <li>
    --names-fps-file &lt;string&gt; The name of a file to which named
      compact fingerprints will be written. These are comma-separated
      lists of the short names of the set bits.
  </li>
  <li>
    --log-file &lt;string&gt; The name of a file to which a lot of the same
      information that is written to the terminal is also written.
  </li>
  <li>
    --bit-names-file &lt;string&gt; The name of a file to which the long
      names of the bits are written, in the correct order. This file 
      allows the individual bits to be de-convoluted. 
  </li>
</ul>
Output is only written to the named files, so, in principle, Loob will
do the whole fingerprint calculation and not write anything, if you
don't give it the name of at least one output file.
